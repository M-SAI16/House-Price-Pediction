# Project Overview

The House Price Prediction system is designed to:
- Analyze housing datasets
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Train regression models
- Predict housing prices based on user input or test data
- Visualize performance metrics and feature relationships

This project showcases a practical application of regression in data science and serves as a great beginner-to-intermediate level project for machine learning practitioners.

# Methodology

The development process includes the following steps:

1. Data Collection  
   - Import housing data (CSV or Excel formats)

2. Data Preprocessing 
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical data (like location)
   - Normalize or scale numerical features

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Correlation analysis
   - Feature importance
   - Price distribution plots

4. Model Building  
   - Linear Regression (or other regression techniques)
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets

5. Model Evaluation  
   - Calculate RÂ² Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE
   - Plot prediction vs actual graphs

6. Prediction Interface  
   - Script or GUI to input parameters and get price prediction
